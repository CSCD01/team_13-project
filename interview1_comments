Comments:

I was very happy to see that the team came fully prepared to deliver a
professional presentation. Every team member seemed to be well
informed and actively participated in the interview.

The team introduction was done well, in a professional manner. 

The project was introduced exceptionally well, including a good
demonstration.

The reasons for selecting the project were presented well.

You presented convincing arguments for choosing the software process.

You answered my questions on the software process well. It would have
been better to hear all the arguments from you without my prompts.

I also suggest you prepare to make sure all team members are equally
prepared to present / answer questions about the software process.

As we have discussed, I would be happy to replace this part of the
interview grade with what you achieve in the second interview.
